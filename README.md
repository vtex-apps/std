# vtex.land/std

The core apps of the `vex` platform.

These apps do not have external dependencies and they are reviewed and maintained by the VTEX IO core team. The intention is to have a standard set of high quality code that all VTEX IO projects can use fearlessly.

Contributions are welcome!

### Recognition

This is heavily inspired by the great work happening at the Deno community.
